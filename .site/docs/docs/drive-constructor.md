The JAR Template drive constructor can build drivetrains with no tracking wheels, but also supports tank and holonomic odometry, with either red optical encoders or V5 rotation sensors. Note that each constructor has the same prototype, and that every drive style **requires** a V5 inertial sensor.

:::caution
**Do not try to add extra motor groups, sensors, or values to the constructor or to remove any that you do not need. The code will not compile. Follow the style of the examples, only filling in fields that are already present.**
:::

:::note
For odometry users using red optical encoders: the top wire of the encoder is always plugged in one port above the bottom wire, and it is the top wire that is indicated in VexCode. So putting the port as "3" means that the encoder is plugged into triports C and D on the brain with the top wire in port C and the bottom wire in port D. Likewise, putting the port as "5" means the encoder is plugged into ports E and F.

## No Tracking Wheels

*Corresponds to ZERO_TRACKER*

Note that for this drive setup, nothing needs to be edited after the gyro scale factor.

## Two V5 Rotation Sensors on a Holonomic Drive

*Corresponds to HOLONOMIC_TWO_ROTATION* 

This setup only works with a four motor X-Drive or mecanum drive. These tracking wheels must be perpendicular to each other. The Forward Tracker is parallel to the direction of travel, and the Sideways Tracker is perpendicular to the direction of travel. Remember to put the Forward and Sideways Tracker ports in "PORT1" format.

//Add the names of your Drive motors into the motor groups below, separated by commas, i.e. motor_group(Motor1,Motor2,Motor3).
//You will input whatever motor names you chose when you configured your robot using the sidebar configurer, they don't have to be "Motor1" and "Motor2".

//Left Motors:
motor_group(LeftFront, LeftBack),

//Right Motors:
motor_group(RightFront, RightBack),

//Specify the PORT NUMBER of your inertial sensor, in PORT format (i.e. "PORT1", not simply "1"):

//Input your wheel diameter. (4" omnis are actually closer to 4.125"):
3.25,

//External ratio, must be in decimal, in the format of input teeth/output teeth.
//If your motor has an 84-tooth gear and your wheel has a 60-tooth gear, this value will be 1.4.
//If the motor drives the wheel directly, this value is 1:
1.6,

//Gyro scale, this is what your gyro reads when you spin the robot 360 degrees.
//For most cases 360 will do fine here, but this scale factor can be very helpful when precision is necessary.
